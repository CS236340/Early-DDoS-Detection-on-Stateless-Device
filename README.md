# Early DDoS Detection on Stateless Device - Project Files

## Before you begin:

- please pay attention to Ubuntu version that is currently recommended for P4 language environment (Ubuntu 14.04 qualifies for April 2016 environment)
- install python pip:
  * sudo apt-get install python-pip

## Installing P4 environment:

1. clone the following P4 language Github repositories:
  1. git clone https://github.com/p4lang/p4c-bm.git p4c-bmv2
    * p4c-bmv2 repository is the compiler for the behavioural model - it generates a JSON file from P4 source code
  2. git clone https://github.com/p4lang/behavioral-model.git bmv2
    * bmv2 repository is the second version of the behavioural model - it is a C++ software switch that is configured by the compiler output file  

2. install p4c-bmv2 including additional dependencies:
  * cd to p4c-bmv2 folder
  * sudo pip install -r requirements.txt
  * sudo python setup.py install
  * check the installation with: p4c-bmv2 -h
	
3. install bmv2 including additional dependencies:
  * cd to bmv2 folder
  * sudo ./install_deps.sh
  * ./autogen.sh
  * ./configure
  * make
	
4. install mininet, scapy, matplotlib and thrift (>= 0.9.2):
  * sudo apt-get install mininet
  * sudo pip install scapy thrift matplotlib
	
## Running DDoS switch:

1. create ddos_switch folder in bmv2->targets; this folder should contain:
  1. the following ASIC folder files:
    * ddos_switch.p4
    * includes sub-folder with:
      * parser.p4
      * headers.p4
  2. the following Driver folder files:
    * driver.h
    * driver.cpp
  3. the following Script folder files:
    * script.py
    * p4_mininet.py
  4. the following Environment folder file:
    * veth_setup.sh

2. additional ASIC folder files:
  1. primitives.json - this file contains the prototypes of DDoS switch primitive actions
    * copy primitives.json to p4c-bmv2->p4c_bm (override existing primitives.json)
    * re-install p4c-bmv2:
      * cd to p4c-bmv2 folder
      * sudo python setup.py install
		
  2. primitives.cpp - this file contains the implementation of DDoS switch primitive actions
    * copy primitives.cpp to bmv2->targets->simple_switch (override existing primitives.cpp)
    * cd to bmv2 folder and call make
	
3. run Virtual Ethernet setup script:
  * cd to ddos_switch folder
  * sudo ./veth_setup.sh
	
4. compile Driver files:
  * check ASIC source and ASIC output Driver paths in the beginning of driver.cpp file
  * cd to ddos_switch folder
  * g++ driver.cpp -o driver -std=c++11
	
5. check the paths that are listed in the beginning of script.py file:
  * BMV2_PATH and P4C_BMV2_PATH should be changed according to p4c-bmv2 and bmv2 clone locations

6. p4_mininet.py is P4 mininet wrapper file that can be changed according to new requirements:
  * customize the path in P4Switch->start function
	
7. run DDoS switch:
  * cd to ddos_switch folder
  * sudo python script.py
  * to get Script input options use:
    * sudo python script.py -h
  * to terminate the Script use:
    * CTRL-C
  * runtime-generated ddos_switch folder files:
    * dos_switch.json file is generated when the Script compiles P4 source code
	* ddos_switch_output.txt contains ASIC registers values for Driver input
	* veth1.pcap file contains the traffic log
	* p4s.s1.log contains thrift server output (for debug purposes: uncomment --log-console option
	in P4Switch->start function of p4_mininet.py file to see the actions that are applied by DDoS switch)
